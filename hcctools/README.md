This repository contains all tools for the computation of host checked coverage (HCC), coverage gap and assertion recommender proposed in the **Measuring and Mitigating Gaps in Structural Testing** paper publish at ICSE-2023

**criteriagen**: automatically generates scripts for slicing criteria as required by JavaSlicer (https://github.com/backes/javaslicer)  

**scc**: computes statement checked coverage  

**obcc**: computes object branch checked coverage  

**testsuitegen**: manipulates a test suite and generate several versions with varied SCC gap. 

**recommender**: generates assertion recommendations to reduce the coverage gaps  

Each specific tool contains a readme with necessary instructions to build the tool and run the tool with required inputs.
