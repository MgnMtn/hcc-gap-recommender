While these scripts can be used directly, we suggest looking at the higher-level, more user-friendly scripts in `experiments/scripts`.

# description of major scripts
* `install_all.sh` builds and installs HCC support jars
* `compute_hcc.stmt.sh` computes SCC metric
* `compute_hcc.ob.sh` computes OBCC metric
* `evaluator.sh` evaluates recommendations produced by HCC
* `trace_tests.sh` generates traces obtained by running tests
* `generate_slicing_scripts.sh` generates scripts needed to slice traces on a per assertion basis
